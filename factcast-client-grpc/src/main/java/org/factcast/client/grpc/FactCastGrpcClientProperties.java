  /**
   * Ignores and skips duplicate exceptions during publishing (does not include conditional
   * publishing when using locks).
   *
   * <p>This might be convenient in cases where you published to a factcast server and get a
   * connection error back (you cannot possibly know if the publish on the server succeeded or not).
   *
   * <p>if you have resilience enabled, the publish would be retried and might (if the first was
   * successful) result in a DuplicateFactException. Setting this to true will make factcast just
   * ignore the exception and go on.
   *
   * <p>Note, that there is no guarantee that the duplicate id of a fact, that will cause the
   * exception on the server, identifies the same payload. Always make sure to create good random
   * UUIDs for your facts.
   *
   * <p>Also, there might be a <b>performance problem</b> resulting from this: If you publish a
   * batch of facts and a DuplicateFactException is recieved, factcast will fall back to publishing
   * every single Fact from the batch one-by-one in order to make sure, that after your call, all
   * Facts that are not duplicates will be published.
