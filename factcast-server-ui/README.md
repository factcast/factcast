## Local deployment

The UI can be started locally by executing the run configuration located in `.run/ExampleUiServer.run.xml`.

To log-in use any username and `security_disabled` as password. The page will be provided under `localhost:8080`.
You now can make changes to the code that will be reflected in the frontend once the service is re-compiled, which 
is done automatically.
