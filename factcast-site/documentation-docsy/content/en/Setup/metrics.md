Being a regular Spring Boot 2+ application, the FactCast Server uses [micrometer.io](https://micrometer.io) as its
metrics emitting/collecting solution. In order to get started collecting the metrics FactCast Server emits, you'll need
to choose a backend/store for your metrics. Micrometer
has [lots of prebuilt bindings to choose from](https://micrometer.io/docs). Please refer to the respective documentation
in the **Setup** section of the micrometer docs.

When it comes to metrics, you'll have to know what you're looking for. There are

- **Server** metrics in FactCast Server as well as
- **Client** metrics in the factcast client and additionally in the
- [factus client library](/usage/factus/metrics).

We're focussing on _Server_ metrics here.

### Metric namespaces and their organization

At the time of writing, there are six namespaces exposed:

- `factcast.server.timer`
- `factcast.server.meter`
- `factcast.store.timer`
- `factcast.store.meter`
- `factcast.registry.timer`
- `factcast.registry.meter`

Depending on your micrometer binding, you may see a slightly different spelling in your data (like '
factcast_store_timer`, if your datasource has a special meaning for the '.'-character)

Furthermore, metrics in operations are automatically tagged with

- an operation name
- a store name ('pgsql' currently) and
- an exception tag ('None' if unset).

### Existing metrics

There are a bunch of metrics already emitted in the server. These metrics can be grouped by type:

- Timers (collecting durations of code execution)
- Meters (collecting metric events, for example, occurrences of errors)

As this list is continuously growing, we cannot guarantee
the documentation's completeness. If you want to see the current list of operations, please look
at [StoreMetrics.java](https://github.com/factcast/factcast/blob/master/factcast-store/src/main/java/org/factcast/store/internal/StoreMetrics.java)
, [RegistryMetrics.java](https://github.com/factcast/factcast/blob/master/factcast-store/src/main/java/org/factcast/store/registry/metrics/RegistryMetrics.java)
,
or [ServerMetrics.java](https://github.com/factcast/factcast/blob/master/factcast-server-grpc/src/main/java/org/factcast/server/grpc/metrics/ServerMetrics.java)
respectively.

At the **time of writing (0.4.3)**, the metrics exposed by the namespaces group `factcast.server` are:

| operation | type    | description                        |
|-----------|---------|------------------------------------|
| handshake | `timer` | Duration of the initial handshake. |

| missedRoundtrip            | `meter` | If inactive for more than a configured interval (`factcast.store.factNotificationBlockingWaitTimeInMillis`), the server validates the health of the database connection. For this purpose it sends an internal notification to the database and waits to receive back an answer in the interval defined by `factcast.store.factNotificationMaxRoundTripLatencyInMillis`. This metric counts the number of notifications sent without an answer from the database. |
| snapshotsCompacted         | `meter` | Counts the number of old snapshots deleted. This runs as a dedicated scheduled job, configured by `factcast.store.snapshotCacheCompactCron`.<br />Ref: [snapshots](/usage/factus/projections/snapshotting/)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### gRPC Metrics

If you're looking for remote calls and their execution times (including marshalling/de-marshalling from protobuf), you
can have a look at the metrics automatically added by
the [gRPC library](https://yidongnan.github.io/grpc-spring-boot-starter/en/)
that we use.
The relevant namespaces are:

- `grpcServerRequestsReceived` and
- `grpcServerResponsesSent`

These automatically added metrics only focus on service methods defined in
the [protocol buffer specs](https://github.com/factcast/factcast/blob/master/factcast-grpc-api/src/main/proto/FactStore.proto).
Since a gRPC remote call triggers not everything we want to measure, we introduced additional metrics. When comparing,
for instance, the automatically added durations of gRPC vs. the 'factcast.store.duration', you will find a subtle
difference. The reason for this is that instead of including the gRPC overhead, we chose to only measure the actual
invocations on the FactStore/TokenStore implementation. Depending on your needs, you may want to focus on one or the
other.

### Executor Metrics

Micrometer provides an integration to monitor the default thread pool executor created by Spring Boot.
Under the same namespace `executor.*`, we publish metrics for our own thread pool executors used inside FactCast.

You can distinguish them by the `name` tag. Currently, these are:

- `subscription-factory` - used for incoming new subscriptions
- `fetching-catchup` - used for buffered transformation while using the fetching catchup strategy
- `paged-catchup` - used for buffered transformation while using the paged catchup strategy
- `transformation-cache` - used for inserting/updating entries in the transformation cache (only if you use persisted cache)

See https://micrometer.io/docs/ref/jvm for more information.
