#### Non-Encrypted

In order to run a simple example FactCast server, you could enter the project **factcast-examples/factcast-example-server**, see [fatjar](../fatjar)

## TLS Server

There is an extra example project that demonstrates the usage of TLS for your server that can be found **factcast-example-tls-server**

We tried to stick as close as possible to what we have in **factcast-examples/factcast-example-server** to demonstrate the necessary changes and nothing more.

Obviously, for running a TLS Server, you need a certificate. We packaged a snakeoil localhost certificate for you to test. This cert can be found in **src/etc/certificates/**. In order to create your own selfsigned certificate, there is a shell script you can use as a starting point.

#### obviously, you should use proper trusted certificates when you run FactCast in production - you have been warned

In order to run the TLS Server, go to **factcast-examples/factcast-example-tls-server** and run

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
