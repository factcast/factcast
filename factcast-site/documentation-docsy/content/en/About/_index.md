FactCast is written in Java & Kotlin and serves as a basis for working in a distributed environment with loosely coupled
software systems that communicate over events.

It provides two APIs for the JVM:

1. FactCast client: low-level, un-opinionated GRPC library to publish / subscribe to facts
2. Factus: high-level, opinionated library working with facts as Objects, as well as abstractions like Aggregates &
   Projections

and also a Schema-Registry that enables FactCast to <b>validate & transform</b> events on the fly.
