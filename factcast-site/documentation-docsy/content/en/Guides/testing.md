This guide refers to a _fact_ as the JSON based data structure which is handled by the low-level FactCast API (see
class `Fact`). In contrast, an _event_ is an abstraction of the Factus library which hides these details and uses Java
POJOs instead (see `EventObject`).

The examples below may use Spring Boot or Lombok. None of those frameworks are necessary for testing, as the Junit5
extension is framework-agnostic. {{% / alert %}}

## Introduction

An event-sourced application usually performs [two kinds of interactions]({{< ref "/concept">}}) with the FactCast
server:

- It subscribes to facts and builds up use-case specific views of the received data. These use-case specific views are
  called _projections_.
- It publishes new facts to the event log.

Building up _projections_ works on both APIs, low-level and Factus. However, to simplify development, the high-level
Factus API has [explicit support for this concept]({{< ref "/usage/factus/projections/types">}}).

### Unit Tests

_Projections_ are best tested in isolation, ideally at the unit test level. In the end, they are classes receiving facts
and updating some internal state. However, as soon as the projection's state is externalized (e.g.
[see here]({{< ref "/usage/factus/projections/atomicity/" >}})) this test approach can get challenging.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests check the interaction of more than one component. Here, we're looking at integration tests that
validate the correct behaviour of a projection that uses an external data store like a Postgres database.

Be aware that FactCast integration tests as shown below can start up real infrastructure via Docker. For this reason,
they **usually perform significantly slower** than unit tests.

## Testing FactCast (low-level)

This section introduces the `UserEmails` projection for which we will write

- unit tests and
- integration tests.

For interaction with FactCast we are using the low-level API.

### The User Emails Projection

Imagine our application needs a set of user emails currently in use in the system. To provide this information, we
identified these facts which contain the relevant data:

- `UserAdded`
- `UserRemoved`

The user `UserAdded` fact contains a user ID and the email address. `UserRemoved`
only carries the user ID to remove.

Here is a possible projection using the FactCast low-level API:

```java
@Slf4j
public class UserEmailsProjection {

    private final Map<UUID, String> userEmails = new HashMap<>();

    @NonNull
    public Set<String> getUserEmails() {
        return new HashSet<>(userEmails.values());
    }

    public void apply(Fact fact) {
        switch (fact.type()) {
            case "UserAdded":
                handleUserAdded(fact);
                break;
            case "UserRemoved":
                handleUserRemoved(fact);
                break;
            default:
                log.error("Fact type {} not supported", fact.type());
                break;
        }
    }

    @VisibleForTesting
    void handleUserAdded(Fact fact) {
        JsonNode payload = parsePayload(fact);
        userEmails.put(extractIdFrom(payload), extractEmailFrom(payload));
    }

    @VisibleForTesting
    void handleUserRemoved(Fact fact) {
        JsonNode payload = parsePayload(fact);
        userEmails.remove(extractIdFrom(payload));
    }

    // helper methods:

    @SneakyThrows
    private JsonNode parsePayload(Fact fact) {
        return FactCastJson.readTree(fact.jsonPayload());
    }

    private UUID extractIdFrom(JsonNode payload) {
        return UUID.fromString(payload.get("id").asText());
    }

    private String extractEmailFrom(JsonNode payload) {
        return payload.get("email").asText();
    }
}
```

The method `apply` acts as an entry point for the projection and dispatches the received `Fact` to the appropriate
handling behavior. There, the `Fact` object's JSON payload is parsed using the Jackson library and the projection's data
(the `userEmails` map), is updated accordingly.

Note, that we chose to avoid using a raw `ObjectMapper` here, but instead use the helper class `FactCastJson` as it
contains a pre-configured ObjectMapper.

To query the projection for the user emails, the `getUserEmails()` method returns the values of our
internal `userEmails` map's values copied to a new `Set`.

### Unit Tests

Unit testing this projection is very easier, as there are no external dependencies. We use `Fact` objects as input and
check the customized view of the internal map.

Let's look at an example for the `UserAdded` fact:

```java
@Test
void whenHandlingUserAddedFactEmailIsAdded() {
    // arrange
    String jsonPayload = String.format(
        "{\"id\":\"%s\", \"email\": \"%s\"}",
        UUID.randomUUID(),
        "user@bar.com");
    Fact userAdded = Fact.builder()
        .id(UUID.randomUUID())
        .ns("user")
        .type("UserAdded")
        .version(1)
        .build(jsonPayload);

    // act
    uut.handleUserAdded(userAdded);

    // assert
    Set<String> emails = uut.getUserEmails();
    assertThat(emails).hasSize(1).containsExactly("user@bar.com");
}
```

Note the use of the convenient builder the `Fact` class is providing.

Since the focus of this unit test is on `handleUserAdded`, we execute the method directly.
[The full unit test](https://github.com/factcast/factcast/tree/master/factcast-itests/factcast-itests-doc/src/test/java/org/factcast/itests/docexample/factcastlowlevel/UserEmailsProjectionTest.java)
also contains a test for the dispatching logic of the `apply` method, as well as a similar test for the `handleUserRemoved` method.

Checking your projection's logic should preferably be done with unit tests in the first place, even though you might
also want to add an integration test to prove it to work in conjunction with its collaborators.

### Integration Tests

FactCast [provides a Junit5 extension]({{< ref "/usage/factus/testing.md" >}}) which starts a FactCast server
pre-configured for testing plus its Postgres database via the excellent testcontainers library and resets their state
between test executions.

#### Preparation

Before writing your first integration test

- make sure Docker is installed and running on your machine
- add the `factcast-test` module to your `pom.xml`:

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.factcast</groupId>
    <artifactId>factcast-test</artifactId>
    <version>${factcast.version}</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

- to allow TLS free authentication between our test code and the local FactCast server, create
  an `application.properties` file in the project's `resources` directory with the following content:

```
grpc.client.factstore.negotiationType=PLAINTEXT
```

This will make the client application connect to the server without using TLS.

#### Writing The Integration Test

Our integration test builds upon the previous unit test example. This time however, we want to check if the
`UserEmailsProjection` can also be updated by a real FactCast server:

```java
@SpringBootTest
@ExtendWith(FactCastExtension.class)
class UserEmailsProjectionITest {

    @Autowired FactCast factCast;

    private final UserEmailsProjection uut = new UserEmailsProjection();

    private class FactObserverImpl implements FactObserver {

        @Override
        public void onNext(@NonNull Fact fact) {
            uut.apply(fact);
        }
    }

    @Test
    void projectionHandlesUserAddedFact() {
        UUID userId = UUID.randomUUID();
        Fact userAdded = Fact.builder()
            .id(UUID.randomUUID())
            .ns("user")
            .type("UserAdded")
            .version(1)
            .build(String.format(
                "{\"id\":\"%s\", \"email\": \"%s\"}",
                userId,
                "user@bar.com"));

        factCast.publish(userAdded);

        SubscriptionRequest subscriptionRequest = SubscriptionRequest
            .catchup(FactSpec.ns("user").type("UserAdded"))
            .or(FactSpec.ns("user").type("UserRemoved"))
            .fromScratch();

        factCast.subscribe(subscriptionRequest, new FactObserverImpl()).awaitComplete();

        Set<String> userEmails = uut.getUserEmails();
        assertThat(userEmails).hasSize(1).containsExactly("user@bar.com");
  }
  //...
```

The previously mentioned `FactCastExtension` starts the FactCast server and the Postgres database _once_ before the
first test is executed. Between the tests, the extension wipes all old facts from the FactCast server so that you are
guaranteed to always start from scratch.

Once a fact is received, FactCast invokes the `onNext` method of the `FactObserverImpl`, which delegates to the `apply`
method of the `UserEmailsProjection`.

For details of the FactCast low-level API please refer to [the API documentation]({{< ref "/usage/lowlevel/java">}}).

## Testing with Factus

Factus builds up on the low-level FactCast API and provides a higher level of abstraction. To see Factus in action we
use the same scenario as before, an `UserEmailsProjection` which we will ask for a set of user emails.

These are the events we need to handle:

- [`UserAdded`](https://github.com/factcast/factcast/tree/master/factcast-itests/factcast-itests-doc/src/main/java/org/factcast/itests/docexample/factus/event/UserAdded.java)
  and
- [`UserRemoved`](https://github.com/factcast/factcast/tree/master/factcast-itests/factcast-itests-doc/src/main/java/org/factcast/itests/docexample/factus/event/UserRemoved.java)
  .

The `UserAdded` event contains two properties, the user ID and the email whereas `UserRemoved` only contains the user ID.

### An Example Event

To get an idea of how the events are defined, let's have a look inside `UserAdded`:

```java
@Getter
@Specification(ns = "user", type = "UserAdded", version = 1)
public class UserAdded implements EventObject {

    private UUID userId;
    private String email;

    // used by Jackson deserializer
    protected UserAdded(){}

    public static UserAdded of(UUID userId, String email) {
        UserAdded fact = new UserAdded();
        fact.userId = userId;
        fact.email = email;
        return fact;
    }

    @Override
    public Set<UUID> aggregateIds() {
        return Collections.emptySet();
      }
}
```

We create a Factus compatible event by implementing the `EventObject` interface and supplying the fact details via
the `@Specification` annotation. The event itself contains the properties `userId` and `email` which are simply fields
of the `UserAdded` class. The `protected` no-args constructor is used by Jackson when deserializing from JSON back to a POJO.
The `of` factory method is used by application- and test code to create an `UserAdded` event. For more details on how to define a Factus event read on
[here]({{< ref "/usage/factus/introduction">}}).

### The User Emails Projection

Now that we know which events to handle, we can process them in the Factus based `UserEmailsProjection`:

```java
public class UserEmailsProjection extends LocalManagedProjection {

    private final Map<UUID, String> userEmails = new HashMap<>();

    public Set<String> getEmails() {
        return new HashSet<>(userEmails.values());
    }

    @Handler
    void apply(UserAdded event) {
        userEmails.put(event.getUserId(), event.getEmail());
    }

    @Handler
    void apply(UserRemoved event) {
        userEmails.remove(event.getUserId());
    }
}
```

You will instantly notice how short this implementation is compared to the `UserEmailsProjection` class of
the low-level API example before. No dispatching or explicit JSON parsing is needed.
Instead, the event handler methods each receive their event as plain Java POJO which is ready to use.

As projection type we decided for a [`LocalManagedProjection`]({{< ref "local-managed-projection.md" >}})
which is intended for self-managed, in-memory use cases. See [here]({{< ref "/usage/factus/projections/types" >}}) for
detailed reading on the various Factus supported projection types.

### Unit Tests

The unit test for this projection tests each handler method individually. As an example, here is the test for
the `UserAdded` event handler:

```java
@Test
void whenHandlingUserAddedEventEmailIsAdded() {
    UUID someUserId = UUID.randomUUID();

    UserEmailsProjection uut = new UserEmailsProjection();
    uut.apply(UserAdded.of(someUserId, "foo@bar.com"));

    Set<String> emails = uut.getEmails();
    assertThat(emails).hasSize(1).containsExactly("foo@bar.com");
}
```

First we create a `userAddedEvent` which we then `apply` to the responsible handler method of the `UserEmailsProjection`
class. To check the result, we fetch the `Set` of emails and, as last part, examine the content.

#### Integration Test

After we have covered each handler method with detailed tests on unit level, we also want an integration test to test
against a real FactCast server.

Here is an example:

```java
@SpringBootTest
@ExtendWith(FactCastExtension.class)
public class UserEmailsProjectionITest {

    @Autowired Factus factus;

    @Test
    void projectionHandlesUserAddedEvent() {
        UserAdded userAdded = UserAdded.of(UUID.randomUUID(), "user@bar.com");
        factus.publish(userAdded);

        UserEmailsProjection uut = new UserEmailsProjection();
        factus.update(uut);

        Set<String> emails = uut.getEmails();
        assertThat(emails).hasSize(1).containsExactly("user@bar.com");
    }
    //...
```

The annotations of the test class are identical to the integration test shown for the low-level API. Hence, we only
introduce them quickly here:

- `@SpringBootTest`
  - starts a Spring container to enable dependency injection of the `factus` Spring bean
- `@ExtendWith(FactCastExtension.class)`
  - starts a FactCast and its Postgres database in the background
  - erases old events inside FactCast before each test

The test itself first creates a `UserAdded` event which is then published to FactCast. Compared to the low-level
integration test, the "act" part is slim and shows the power of the Factus API:
The call to `factus.update(...)` builds a subscription request for all the handled events of the `UserEmailsProjection`
class. The events returned from FactCast are then automatically applied to the correct handler.

The test concludes by checking if the state of the `UserEmailsProjection` was updated as correctly.
