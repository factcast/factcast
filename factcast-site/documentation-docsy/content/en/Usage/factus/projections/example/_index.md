In here, you will find some examples that you can use as a simple blueprint to get started building projections.
We make use of some **abstract** classes here that might be more convenient to use. Feel free to study the
implementations of those abstracts to see what is going on, especially when you plan to implement projections with
different datastore than what we use in the examples.
