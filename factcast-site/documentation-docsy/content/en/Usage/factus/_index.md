This section will walk you through using FactCast from an application programmers perspective using the abstractions of
Factus. Factus is an optional high-level API provided in order to make it easier to work with FactCast from Java (or
Kotlin or any other JVM language of your choice).

**Please be aware that the Factus API is in experimental stage and is expected to change while getting more mature.**
If you find sharp edges or feel like things are missing,
please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/factcast/factcast/issues/new/choose).

If you want to have more control and don't want to opt in to Factus, you can have a look at the lower-level FactCast
API. See the [Lowlevel](/usage/lowlevel) section instead.
