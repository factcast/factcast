description: Options for deploying the FactCast server-ui.
---

The FactCast server-ui can be deployed together with the server or standalone in a separate container. It requires the
same configuration parameters that are used for the server itself (documented [here](../../Setup/properties.md)).
In addition, you should set `readOnlyModeEnabled` to true.
