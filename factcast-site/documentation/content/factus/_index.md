This section will walk you through using FactCast from an application programmers perspective using the abstractions of Factus.
Factus is an optional high-level API provided in order to make it easier to work with FactCast from Java (or Kotlin).

If you want to have more control and don't want to opt-in to Factus, you can have a look at the lower-level FactCast API. See the [Lowlevel](/lowlevel) section instead.
