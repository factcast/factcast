## keep-alive settings

Here are some good settings for an initial configuration of a SpringBoot FactCast client/server setup in case you ran into gRPC related client server communication troubles.

* Sending keep-alive HTTP/2 PINGs on the connection is useful in case you are running on infrastructure that doesn't support configurable idle timeouts, and threfore closes connections.

* The proposed values are defining a scenario where the client sends keep-alive HTTP/2 PINGs every 300s and the server accepts this behavior without sending `GO_AWAY ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM` to the client. Please adobt to your specific needs.

### Client side

|Property|Description|Proposed value|
|:--|:--|:--|
|`grpc.client.factstore.enable-keep-alive`       | Configures whether keepAlive shoud be enabled. Defaults to false. | true |
|`grpc.client.factstore.keep-alive-time`         | The default delay before sending keepAlives. Defaults to 60s. Please note that shorter intervals increase the network burden for the server. | 300 |
|`grpc.client.factstore.keep-alive-without-calls`| Configures whether keepAlive will be performed when there are no outstanding RPCs on a connection. Defaults to false. | true |

Further details can be found here : `net.devh.boot.grpc.client.config.GrpcChannelProperties`.

### Server side

|Property|Description|Proposed value|
|:--|:--|:--|
|`grpc.server.permit-keep-alive-without-calls`|  Configures whether clients are allowed to send keep-alive HTTP/2 PINGs even if there are no outstanding RPCs on the connection. Defaults to false.| true |
|`grpc.server.permit-keep-alive-time`          | Specifies the most aggressive keep-alive time in seconds clients are permitted to configure. Defaults to 5min. | 100 |

Further details can be found here : `net.devh.boot.grpc.server.config.GrpcServerProperties`.
