/**
 * Only works on subclasses of {@link org.factcast.factus.redis.AbstractRedisSubscribedProjection}.
 *
 * <p>Enables that the methods {@link AbstractRedisSubscribedProjection#onCommit()} and {@link
 * AbstractRedisSubscribedProjection#onRollback()} will be invoked when the tx manager commits or
 * rolls back.
 *
 * <p>Attention, in case you are adding this to projections that are already deployed, it would be
 * safer to increase the serial of the projection. Otherwise, during the first deployment, some
 * updates might get lost when the instance that processes does not have this annotation, and the
 * newly deployed instances do not have the lock but expect the callbacks.
