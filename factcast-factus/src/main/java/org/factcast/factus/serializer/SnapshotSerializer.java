   * ignore them for serialization (e.g. by using @JsonIgnore with Jackson).

   * changes to the projection where made that were relevant for deserialization.
   *
   * <p>This method is only used if no other means of providing a hash is used. Alternatives are
   * using the @ProjectionSerial annotation or defining a final static long field called
   * serialVersionUID.

   * <p>Note, that the serial will be cached per class
