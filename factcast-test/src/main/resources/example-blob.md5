. shy
+ better after ice broken

- no code in 15 mins
- setter reflex (encap)
+ overwrite toString instead
- code dupl, instead of extracted method
- no dice
+ hit method to strike a hit in knight class
- lowering life energy via setter
- non-obvious boolean return not documented
? concurrentModification is unknown (ListIterator)
- weird state interpretation (instead of iter.previous())
+ talks about state and behaviour (hint to OO)
+ extracts player properly
- it is the weapon that has constant hitpoer, not the player type (Mattias fault)
. O(1) vs O(n): wrong, but nice that she thinks about it
+ design question: weapon more than one?
. does not have much intellij magic at hand
+ gotDamage (receive)
+ not easily confuse (heal by armor)
+ new Random() every time
- setter on supposedly final fields
- no optional
+ she got the healing aspect of the armor (missin precond. check)
- loglines should have use player tostring
 








mattia
every knight has a die (vs passes the die)
prototype VC
debuglines
THE correct solution
evaluate, patterns
IDs, you gave it away
--------------


all things in one is bad:
elves
weapons
+constant hit points

might have been intentional?

print line can go to abstract (let her find out)

split class: "Good to know" :D broke the ice !

motivation for armor: monetarization of the game (shopping)

+ armor -2 is clever (what if hit with only one)
+ armor being _optional_ is good
